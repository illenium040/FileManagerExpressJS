# Instalation

I use postgreSQL, so change variable to connect to database in backend/.env file and use create.sql script to create tables.<br>

You can: 
- Add folder/file
- Delete folder/file
- Upload files (but only small files, images will cause 'request entity too large' exception)
- Rename folder/file
